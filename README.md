# Key Notes

1. Undetected chromium driver is the key
2. Its better to use autoclick and mouse keyboard emulation on a spare computer than to launch browser through selenium
3. Even better if you can use bluestacks or another mobile emulator to fake location and mobile device environment
4. Uses a discord.py-self to monitor channels. Make sure to use an alt account as this breaks TOS
5. Educational purposes only -- use responsibly
